# Want to contribute some code? 

## Weâ€™d really appreciate your support!

- If the [Github issue](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/issues) for your feature/bug fix already exists, write a message in that issue saying you want to work on it. 
- Otherwise, please [post on the GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/discussions) and say that you are planning to do some coding and explain why. Then we can discuss the specification. 
- Please only start coding after we have agreed to a specification to avoid putting lots of work into something which may not get accepted later.

## Jamulus project/source code general principles

### Stability
This has been, and must continue to be, the most important requirement. It is particularly important for use cases such as the Worldjam where instability during a live performance would be unacceptable. The following two principles are designed to support this principle.

### [Keep it Simple and Stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and [Do One Thing and Do It Well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well)
If a feature or function can be achieved in another way by another system or method, then that is preferable to building that feature into Jamulus. 

### Focus on and improve the strengths of Jamulus
There are other solutions for real time online jamming available. But Jamulus stands alone with its client/server system, minimalistic GUI and simple functionality. 

### Source code consistency
- Respect the existing code style: Tab size=4, insert spaces.
- Space before and after `(` and `)`, except no space between `)` and `;`, and no space before an empty `()`.
- All bodies of `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, etc., to be enclosed in braces `{` and `}`, on separate lines.

Make sure (if possible) that your code compiles on Windows/Mac/Linux.
Do not use diff/patch to send your code changes but create a Github fork of the Jamulus code and create a Pull Request when you are done.
### Supported platforms
We strive to support the following platforms and versions:
- Windows 10 <!-- Is this the only version? Do we have to specify a specific sub-version? -->
- Mac <!-- Which versions? -->
- Ubuntu Linux 18.04 or later, Debian 10 or later, most Linux flavors with recent enough Qt versions
<!-- Do we support BSD? I think a recent discussion was about FreeBSD? -->
<!-- Should we already list Android? If so, what platforms/versions? -->

The minimum Qt version to support is 5.X <-- What is it? -->

Please try hard to avoid breaking any of them by avoiding to introduce platform-specific code and checking if any newly introduced Qt calls are available in our minimum Qt version.

### Dependencies
If your code requires new dependencies, be extra sure that those are available on all supported platforms and that the introduction of those has been discussed and accepted.
### Documentation/Acknowledgements
Each new feature or bug fix must be documented in the ChangeLog. Please provide a single-sentence suggestion for that as part of your pull request description. Do not modify the ChangeLog file as part of your PR as it will lead to conflicts.

If you are a first-time contributor/translator, please add yourself to the contributor/translator list in the About dialog of the Jamulus software (see in `src/util.cpp` in the constructor function `CAboutDlg::CAboutDlg()`).

### Merging Pull Requests
The git master branch is protected to require at least two reviews by the main developers before the pull request can be merged. If a pull request receives at least two positive reviews, any of the main developers can initiate the merge.
